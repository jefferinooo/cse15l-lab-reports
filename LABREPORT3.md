Lab Report 3

Researching  Commands:  Find Command
---

1) Finding a specific file with a specific name
---
Example 1
```
find ./written_2 -name Cuba-History.txt
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Cuba-History.txt
```
With this command, I am trying to find the Cuba-History.txt file. This command is useful because it returns the directory that the file is contained in, which is ./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/

My source for this example is from Week 4 of lab where I was encouraged to do a web search to learn about the -name option for find.


Example 2
```
find ./written_2 -name WhereToMalaysia.txt
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToMalaysia.txt
```
With this command, I am trying to find the WhereToMalaysia.txt file. This command is useful because it returns the directory ./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/

My source for this example is from Week 4 of lab where I was encouraged to do a web search to learn about the -name option for find.
