Researching  Commands:  Find Command
---

1) Finding a specific file with a specific name
---

```
find ./written_2 -name Cuba-History.txt
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Cuba-History.txt
```
With this command, I am trying to find the Cuba-History.txt file. This command is useful because it returns the directory that the file is contained in.
