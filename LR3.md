Part 1

For this first screenshot, the methods in my code that are called are getPath(), contains(), getQuery(), split(), equals(), and concat(). The respective relevant arguments to these  methods are /add-message?s=Hello for getPath, /add-message for contains, s=Hello for getQuery(), s= for split(), “” for equals(), and \n for concat(). The relevant fields that get changed from this specific request are “string.” Since the string is initially blank,  the string becomes “Hello” and becomes concat with \n. 

For this second screenshot, the methods in my code that are called are getPath(), contains(), getQuery(), split(), equals(), and concat(). The respective relevant arguments to these  methods are /add-message?s=Hello for getPath, /add-message for contains, s=Hello for getQuery(), s= for split(), “” for equals(), and \n for concat(). The relevant fields that get changed from this specific request are “string.” Right now, the string is “Hello\n” after the previous screenshot. After this screenshot, the string adds “How are you\n” making the string “Hello\nHow are you\n”.
