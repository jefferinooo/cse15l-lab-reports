Monday, January 16, you’ll submit a lab report by writing a blog post like we just described. The topic will be remote access.

You will write a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!) about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6. Your post should include the steps you took, along with screenshots of what each step looked like. You’re free to use the screenshots you took for lab 1, or new ones. Complete any steps you didn’t complete in your group on your own.

Overall, make sure you have at least 3 screenshots, one for each of the steps below (though more is useful, remember that this will help out your future self). For each step include 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did. If for some reason you didn’t do the step exactly, describe why not (maybe your computer already had something on it, maybe the department computers worked differently, etc).

Installing VScode
Remotely Connecting
Trying Some Commands
You should complete the writing on your own. Feel free to ask anyone (staff or other students are fine!) for help if you’re struggling to get remote access set up, understand commands, get your writing to show up on Github Pages, etc. But do not get help from anyone on authoring the report itself – the writing and screenshots must be your own.

You will upload your submission by publishing the page on Github Pages, then printing the page to PDF and uploading to the Lab Report 1 assignment on Gradescope.

**How I Logged Into A Course-Specific Account On iEng6**

My tutorial will specifically be for students who are using a Mac device and will be catered to those who are using such devices.

1. Searching for Your Account
  * I went to https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php and put in my username and student ID
  * insert picture of the page here
  * I looked for the account that starts with "cs15lwi23" followed by various letters
  * insert picture where I can see the account
  * I looked for the change password button and made a password that was at least 13 characters long then waited for the change to take effect
  * Now you should be aware of your course-specific account and password since you just reset it

2. Visual Studio Code
  * I went to https://code.visualstudio.com/, and downloaded Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
  * I opened VS Code and opened a Terminal by going to Terminal at the Top and clicking New Terminal
  * insert picture of VS Code

3. Remotely Connecting with VSCode
  * Since I am on a Mac, I did not have to download git or bash. Windows users will need to do so before following the same steps I am doing.
  * In the terminal, I typed in the following command (ignore the $, just type everything after and replace LETTERS corresponding with your respective account): $ cs15lwi23LETTERS@ieng6.ucsd.edu
  * Don't forget that after you type in your account to put @ieng6. then ucsd.edu, this was a mistake that I made when I was remotely connecting
  * After this, it will verify if you want to connect to the server. Put yes.
  * insert picture requesting verification to connect
  * Then, it will ask for your password. If you try typing it, you won't see anything but the keys are being registered. It is hidden for privacy reasons.
  * Once you are logged in, it will show you a display and status.
  * insert picture of what it looks like when youre logged in here

4. Running Commands
