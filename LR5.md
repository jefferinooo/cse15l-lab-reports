# Lab Report  5

Reflecting on Lab Report 4
---
* Lab Report 4 was the reproduction of the competition from lab. It was 9 steps.
* Recap of the steps:
* Step 1: Delete existing forks of repository
* Step 2: Fork repository
* Step 3: Start timer
* Step 4: Log into ieng6
* Step 5: Clone fork from github account
* Step 6: Run tests
* Step 7: Fix tests
* Step 8: Commit and push resulting change into the Github account

How I Would Use A Bash Script To Speed This Up
---
* I would write a bash script to automate steps 1-6.
* Step 1: I would use "rm filename" where filename is the directory.
* Step 2: I would "github repo fork GITHUBLINK" where GITHUBLINK is the URL.
* Step 3: I would code a loop to make a timer.
* Step 4: I would type in "ssh USERNAME" where username is my username
* Step 5: I would do "git clone LINK" where LINK is the url.
* Step 6: I would add the javac and java commands for the tester.
* Step 7: I don't remember how to use a bash script to edit a file, so I would end the first bash script here and manually  fix the error
* Step 8: I would use a second bash script to use the javac and java commands again to show they succeed.
* Step 9: I would use "git commit" and "git push" in the bash script

With this implementation, I would be drastically speeding up Lab Report 4's time.
